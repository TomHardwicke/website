<hr />
<p><em>This is the first of two-part blog with <a href="https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/">Mike Frank</a>.</em></p>
<p>Psychology is currently navigating a turbulent period of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1745691612465253">crisis</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1745691617751884">opportunity</a>. Serious concerns about the credibility of the published literature have led to calls for the adoption of <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/sm78t">transparent</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021">reproducible</a> research practices, and an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1745691615609918">increasingly sophisicated technological apparatus</a> has <a href="http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.158">eliminated most practical road blocks</a> that might previously have undermined these ambitions.</p>
<p>Data availability has recieved particular attention because it is a necessary pre-requisite for several important research activities that facilitate verification, discovery, and evidence synthesis (see Figure <a href="#fig:open-data-activities">1</a>). Unfortunately, <a href="https://tomhardwicke.netlify.com/blog/attrition-scholarly-record/">most scientific data is unlikely to be available</a>. To address this, some journals have introduced open data policies that either <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456">encourage</a> or <a href="http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.102">mandate</a> data sharing, and initial empirical investigations suggest that they are associated with higher rates of data availability. These steps towards increased data availability are encouraging, however, the extent to which the theoretical benefits of data sharing can actually be realized in practice is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Open data only have utility if they are actually reusable. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456">A study</a> of the ‘open badges’ scheme flagged some concerns along these lines: a substantial proportion (50/111, 45%) of reportedly available data (from studies with and without badges) was in fact not available, incomplete, incorrect, or had insufficient documentation. In order to further investigate this issue, we began a study that capitalized on the introduction of an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2014.11.004">open data policy</a> at the journal <em>Cognition</em> in March 2015. Unlike the badges scheme, data sharing was mandatory under this policy: all authors had to make their data files publicly available online before their articles would be published. We evaluated 417 articles submitted pre-policy and 174 articles submitted post-policy. Introduction of this mandatory policy was associated with a substantial increase in the number of articles reporting available data, although 38/174 (22%) post-policy articles did not comply (Figure <a href="#fig:ITS-plot">2</a>).</p>

<p>Farily good news so far, but how many of these data sets were actually reusable? In cases where a data set was reportedly available, we attempted to download and open it (accessibility), recorded whether all data needed for evaluation and reproduction of the research had been shared (completeness), and noted whether the data set was sufficiently well documented (understandability). The findings of this exercise (Figure <a href="#fig:reusable-plot">3</a>) are rather troubling. Fortunately most data sets were accessible. However, only 23/103 (22%) accessible data sets in the pre-policy period appeared to be reusable (both complete and understandable). There was substantial improvement in the post-policy period, however still only 85/133 (64%) of accessible data sets were deemed reusable.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomhardwicke.netlify.com/blog/attrition-scholarly-record/">Most scientific data is unlikely to be available</a> and for most available data, reusability is unknown. Our findings suggest that promoting data availability without attending to the issue of data curation could be misguided. Our initial visual assessment of data files is likely to underestimate the problem – if we had actually tried to re-use the data in practice it seems likely that additional issues would emerge. Indeed, when we <em>did</em> try to re-use the data for a subset of 35 articles in an attempt to establish their analytic reproducibility, several issues with the data files emerged that we hadn’t previously spotted. We will discuss these findings in more detail in another blog post.</p>
<p>If available data are not well curated then this seriously undermines their utility. That’s why we’ve recommended that journals with open data policies also provide guidance to authors on how to adquately prepare their data files to maximise thier utility. Curating data is not as straightforward as it might seem. It requires some imagination to comprehend the variable naming scheme that seems completely logical to you in the present moment might make no sense to one of your colleagues, or even yourself in a few months time. Here are some tips we have learned for improving the reusability of data files (please do share your own tips in the comments section below):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>share data in a machine-readable and human-readable format that does not rely on proprietary software. Comma-separated values (csv) is a good default.</p></li>
<li><p>if there are no negative constraints (e.g., privacy issues), share the rawest possible digital version of the data (Figure <a href="#fig:data-hierarchy">4</a>). In cases where a great deal of pre-processing is required (e.g., eye-tracking data), it is also extremely helpful to share “basic level” data i.e., data summarised at the most relevant unit of analysis (in psychology this is typically the participant level).</p></li>
<li><p>organise data logically, for example in <a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">‘tidy’ format</a>, where each variable is a column and each observation is a row.</p></li>
<li><p>accompany your data with ‘metadata’ – the who, what, where, why, and when, of the data collection process.</p></li>
<li><p>if it is not too cumbersome, use human legible long form for column headings and group codes. For example, rather than “sbj” use “subject” or “participant id”, and rather than “1” and “2” write out “male” and “female”. If this gets messy, at least provide translation of your short-hand in a separate data dicitonary/codebook (below)</p></li>
<li><p>provide a data dictionary/codebook. There are nifty automated tools that will generate codebooks for you, for example the R package <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/generating-codebooks-in-r/">dataMaid</a> and <a href="https://rubenarslan.ocpu.io/codebook/www/">codebook</a> which can used with R, SPSS, and Stata.</p></li>

<p>It is encouraging to hear about new efforts to increase data availability, however the findings of our recent study suggest that additional attention is needed to the issue of data curation. If available data is not reusable data then the in-principle benefits of data sharing will not be realised in practice.</p>
